I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the [Department of Materials Science and Engineering](https://mse.engr.uconn.edu/) at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/) (UConn). I have been a student visitor (intern) at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/) (LANL) since I started my graduate career in 2016. [Prof. Serge Nakhmanson](https://satori.ims.uconn.edu/) is my primary thesis advisor at UConn and [Dr. Jian-Xin Zhu](https://www.lanl.gov/expertise/profiles/view/jianxin-zhu) has been my mentor during my concurrent visits to LANL. 

My research focuses on utilizing various atomistic simulations, data mining and machine learning methods to study materials functionalities. As broad as it sounds, my interests lie both in the field of organic ferroelectrics and inorganic functional materials (including but not limited to perovskites, actinides). 

I received my Bachelors Degree (with Hons.) in Physics and Abstract Mathematics from [University of Michigan-Flint](https://www.umflint.edu/) in 2015. I have worked with Dr. James Alsup and Dr. Rajib Ganguly during my undergraduate years in Michigan. Summer months in 2013 and 2014 were spent performing characterization (ellipsometry, XRD, laser interferometry) experiments at [New Mexico State University](https://www.nmsu.edu/) with [Prof. Stefan Zollner](http://physics.nmsu.edu/people/facstaff/StefanZollner.html) and at [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/) with [Prof. Donald Umstadter](https://www.unl.edu/diocles/umstadter.shtml), respectively. 


And of course, before my first flight to USA in 2011, I was busy living in Chandannagar, West Bengal, India, with my parents and dreaming to travel around the globe while searching for 'something scientific' to keep me motivated.
